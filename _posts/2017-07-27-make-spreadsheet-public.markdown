Now that you have a Google Sheet with the proper column field names, and date entered into your spreadsheet, you will need to make the Google Sheet public. To do this, when you are in your Google Sheet, select from the File menu, and choose the publish to the web option. This will give you a modal window allowing you to configure how you'd like to share the Google Sheet publicly.

When making your Google Sheet public you can choose to make the entire Google Sheet public, or just a single worksheet public--I leave this to you, based upon the data you are making available. Each worksheet will become a single YAML data store in the Github repository, something you will be able to configure when you pull your data later on in this lesson. Once you publish your Google Sheet to the web, you can copy and save the public URL to spreadsheet for sharing with others--all we will need from it to continue is the ID in the URL, which we'll discuss shortly.
