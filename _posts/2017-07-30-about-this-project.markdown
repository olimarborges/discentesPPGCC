This is the first lesson in an ongoing series of lessons I a developing as part of our Contrafabulists effort, and my own API Evangelist work. The goal is to provide short, easily consumed lessons around specific platforms, technology, and in many cases APIs. Each lesson runs as a Google Sheet with a corresponding Github repository and website that is driven by YAML, Liquid and HTML. 

Appropriately my first lesson is about how to setup a lesson using this approach to data driven sites using Github Pages, with data stored in a Google Sheet. I have a Google Sheet that I've added a row for each step in this lesson, then using a JavaScript I publish these steps to this lessons Github repository, using the Github API. Each step in the lesson is published as a single "blog post" in the Jekyll _posts folder for the Github repository.

I'm hoping you will leave this lesson with the ability to publish your own lessons in this way, and any other type of data driven site in this way. Each step in this lesson has a title, body, image, and in some cases audio or video. I'm also adding a support button which will take you to the Github issues for each step in this lesson, where you can engage in conversations abou the step, and ask questions of the author and other users. I'm looking forward to your feedback, so I can improve on the lesson for future students.
