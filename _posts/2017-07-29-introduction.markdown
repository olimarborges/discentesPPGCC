This is a lesson in how to pubish and manage a data driven website using Google Sheets as the data source, and Github Pages as the public website. Think of it as a low costs static way of doing WordPress, but instead of a MySQL database we are using Google Sheets, and instead of PHP we are using Jekyll, with everything hosted on Github Pages. 

So, why would you want to do this?

- **Low Cost** - Google Sheets, and Github Pages (if public) is free to use.
- **Static** - The end result is a static website that is just HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images.
- **Secure** - Static sites do not have all the dynamic aspects of WordPress, opening up fewer doors for bad folks to find.
- **Low Tech** - It is a scrappy, low tech way of doing things, allowing anyone to publish a simple data driven project site.

This lesson is a living project, and depends on the feedback of students to help improve. The lesson lives within the project's Github repository as YAML entries in the _posts folder. We are mimicking blog behavior to take advantage of a key Jekyll feature, allowing each step of the lesson to live as a individual entry--allowing users to navigate through the lesson until the final entry. 

This lesson is an open project that lives on Github allowing it to be forked by anyone, and implemented under any other Github organization or user account. You can participate in the lesson  using the issues section for the project Github repository, available at each step in the lesson as a link. Thank you for tuning in, and we look forward to your feedback on the lesson.
